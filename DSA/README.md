# What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a storage format that defines the way data is stored, organized, and manipulated. Some popular data structures are Arrays, Trees, and Graphs.

# What is an Array?
An array is commonly referred to as a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. Items stored are of the same type. It organizes data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.

# What is a Linked List?
Like an array, a linked list refers to a linear data structure in which the elements are not necessarily stored in a contiguous manner. It is basically a sequence of nodes, each node points towards the next node forming a chain-like structure.

# What are the concepts introduced in OOPs?
Following are the concepts introduced in OOPs:

Object - A real-world entity having a particular state and behavior. We can define it as an instance of a class.

Class - A logical entity that defines the blueprint from which an object can be created or instantiated.

Inheritance - A concept that refers to an object gaining all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It provides code reusability.

Polymorphism - A concept that allows a task to be performed in different ways. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Abstraction - A concept that hides the internal details of an application and only shows the functionality. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

Encapsulation - A concept that refers to the wrapping of code and data together into a single unit.
