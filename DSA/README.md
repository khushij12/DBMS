# What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a storage format that defines the way data is stored, organized, and manipulated. Some popular data structures are Arrays, Trees, and Graphs.

# What is an Array?
An array is commonly referred to as a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. Items stored are of the same type. It organizes data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.

# What is a Linked List?
Like an array, a linked list refers to a linear data structure in which the elements are not necessarily stored in a contiguous manner. It is basically a sequence of nodes, each node points towards the next node forming a chain-like structure.

# What is LIFO?
# What is a Stack?
# What is FIFO?
# What is a Queue?
# What are Binary Trees?
# What is Recursion?
# What is the OOPs concept?
# What are the concepts introduced in OOPs?
Following are the concepts introduced in OOPs:

Object - A real-world entity having a particular state and behavior. We can define it as an instance of a class.

Class - A logical entity that defines the blueprint from which an object can be created or instantiated.

Inheritance - A concept that refers to an object gaining all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It provides code reusability.

Polymorphism - A concept that allows a task to be performed in different ways. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Abstraction - A concept that hides the internal details of an application and only shows the functionality. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

Encapsulation - A concept that refers to the wrapping of code and data together into a single unit.

# Explain what a Binary Search Tree is.
# Explain Doubly Linked Lists?
# What is a Graph?
# Explain overloading and overriding with the help of a program?
Overloading: When a class has two or more methods with the same name, they are called overloaded methods.
Overriding: When a superclass method is also implemented in the child class, it’s a case of overriding.
# How do you remove all occurrences of a given character from the input string?
Use the built-in string method “replace” to replace a character with any other character, including symbols and white spaces.
String str1 = "Australia";

str1 = str1.replace("a", "");
# What are dynamic data structures?
Dynamic data structures have the feature where they expand and contract as a program runs. It provides a very flexible method of data manipulation because adjusts based on the size of the data to be manipulated.

# How does variable declaration affect memory?
The amount of memory that is to be reserved or allocated depends on the data type being stored in that variable. 

# Which sorting algorithm is the best?
There are many types of sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort, balloon sort, merge sort, radix sort, and more.
No algorithm can be considered as the best or fastest because they have designed each for a specific type of data structure where it performs the best

# What is a Deque?
A deque is a double-ended queue.
This is a structure in which elements can be inserted or removed from either end
